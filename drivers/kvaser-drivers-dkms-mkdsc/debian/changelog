DEBIAN_PACKAGE-dkms (MODULE_VERSION) stable; urgency=low

  * Common
    - fixed bug where a call to canIOCTL_TX_INTERVAL could cause a crash if 
      TX_INTERVAL is unsupported by the device.
    - BusStatistics increments between calls to canGetBusStatistics. Previously,
      it was cleared. The function now has the same behavior as in Windows.

  * PCIEcan
    - Implemented canGetBusStatistics for reading the busload value.
    - BusStatistics now separates correctly on standard and extended id frames.
