DEBIAN_PACKAGE-dkms (MODULE_VERSION) stable; urgency=low

  * SDK (canlib)
    - The message data buffer is untouched when reading a remote request frame
      as identified by the canMSG_RTR flag.
    - canGetBusStatistics reports the same result if transmit acknowledge is 
      off (0) or on (1). Transmit acknowledge is set by ioctl canIOCTL_SET_TXACK.
    - Fixed a bug in kvFileCopyToDevice.

    - Implemented the following tScript functions: 
      kvScriptStatus and kvScriptLoadFileOnDevice.
      kvScriptEnvvarOpen and kvScriptEnvvarClose.
      kvScriptEnvvarSetInt and kvScriptEnvvarGetInt.
      kvScriptEnvvarSetFloat and kvScriptEnvvarGetFloat.
      kvScriptSendEvent.
      kvScriptGetText and kvScriptRequestText.

  * SDK (kvlclib)
    - Fixed a bug that, when a frame didn't have any signals in the dbc-file,
      signal-names from other frames wheren't printed out.
    - Added API function kvlcEventCountEx, handling the situation where the number
      of events exceeds the size of an int.

  * SDK (kvadblib)
    - Added API function GetLastParseError. Call GetLastParseError to get more
      information if kvadblib encounters format issues when loading a database
      from file.
    - Fixed a bug where non J1939 frames was faulty determined as J1939 frames.
    - Improved the behaviour when reading certain .dbc files with syntax errors
      so as not to cause crashes.
    - Flag KVADB_MESSAGE_J1939 is now set for J1939 frames in
      call to kvaDbGetMsgFlags.

  * SDK (kvmlib)
    - Added API functions kvmLogFileGetType.
    - Added API functions kvmLogFileMountEx and kvmKmeCountEventsEx,
      handling the situation where the number of events exceeds the size of an int.

  * Common
    - fixed bug where a call to canIOCTL_TX_INTERVAL could cause a crash if 
      TX_INTERVAL is unsupported by the device.
    - BusStatistics increments between calls to canGetBusStatistics. Previously,
      it was cleared. The function now has the same behavior as in Windows.

  * PCIEcan
    - Implemented canGetBusStatistics for reading the busload value.
    - BusStatistics now separates correctly on standard and extended id frames.
